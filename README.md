In this Problem, you have to write an application in Python 3.7 that maps IPL franchises and players as per the below guidelines.  Assume that you are a news reporter and you want to map which players have been associated with a franchise (either in the past or present). For this you need to have some system of storing these players and the franchise they have been with. Assume that you have a list of N franchises and M players. For the sake of this assignment, let us assume that a particular player could be associated with only two franchises at max.
